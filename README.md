Repository Name: MSPUS-20-year-chart

Description:
This repository contains a Python script for visualizing demand data using the popular pandas and matplotlib libraries. The script reads a CSV file titled 'demand.csv', which can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/factors-influence-house-price-in-us and plots the data to display the trend of 'MSPUS' (Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States) over time.

Key Features:
- Uses pandas to load and preprocess the demand data from 'demand.csv'.
- Utilizes matplotlib to create a line plot showing the 'MSPUS' values over time based on the 'Date' column.
- Properly handles datetime format for better visualization on the x-axis.
- Supports easy customization and extension for other visualizations and data exploration.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository or download the 'MSPUS over time.py' and 'demand.csv' files.
2. Make sure you have pandas and matplotlib installed (use 'pip install pandas matplotlib').
3. Update the 'demand.csv' file path if needed.
4. Run the script using Python (e.g., 'python script.py') to view the demand data visualization.

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to this project. Any feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated!

Enjoy exploring the demand data and its visualization using Python!
